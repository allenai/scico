            <p>We want to enable <em>faceted search</em> of scientific papers based

                    and Named-Entity Recognition (NER), and RNN is the <strong>parent category</strong> of LSTM.&nbsp;
                The output is a list of papers using RNN (or LSTM) for one of the tasks. 
                There are many in which papers refer to the concept of sequence tagging or to RNN. We want to find all of these <Text mark>co-referring</Text> mentions, excluding those with only <Text><Wrong>surface similarity</Wrong></Text>.

                Please do the following "guided" annotations in which you'll be provided with short annotation texts 
                and weâ€™ll guide you to the right <span className="message">linking decision</span> along the way. You'll get the feedback on the <span className="message">hierarchy</span> at the end.

            You can annotate both the linking and the hierarchy together or alternate between these two tasks. 
            <Text strong> We strongly recommend annotating both tasks simultaneously</Text> - if you wait until after seeing all candidates, 
            it may be difficult to recall what some of the clusters refer to. 
            As shown above, you can also add notes to cluster names after adding them - to help you remember their meaning. 
            This could be especially useful with cluster names that are very similar but have different meanings.
